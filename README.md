# University admissions predictions from two exams

This project considers a dataset which include test result of students of two exams.
It then considers the training data and considers a set of training examples and uses Regularized Logistic Regression to predict whether a student shoud be given admission in a university or not baed on their marks of the two exams.

This code has been written in Octave and can be opened in Octave or Matlab.

To run the code simply run ex2_reg.m in either Octave or Matlab.

On running it plots the graph and shows which students are eligible to get the admission (inside the decision boundary). This code can be further arranged to give out the exam roll numbers of students who have passed and be displayed in a screen or imported to a file.
